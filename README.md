# Titanic-ML-Challenge
Titanic Survival Prediction
===========================

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. The dataset is from the Kaggle Titanic competition.

Requirements
------------

-   Python 3.6 or later
-   pandas
-   numpy
-   scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

Copy code

`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`

Dataset
-------

Download the dataset files `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the Kaggle Titanic competition page and place them in the same directory as the script.

-   [train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/train.csv)
-   [test.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/test.csv)

Usage
-----

1.  Save the code provided in the previous answer in a file named `titanic.ipynb`.

2.  Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` dataset files in the same directory as the script.

3.  Run the script using the following command:

Copy code

`python titanic.ipynb`

1.  After the script finishes executing, you'll find a `submission.csv` file in the same directory. This file contains the predictions for the test dataset and can be submitted to Kaggle to check the accuracy of your model.
